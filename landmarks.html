            <h3>Stonehenge</h3>
            <p>A prehistoric monument that was believed to be constructed around 4 thousand years ago (3000 to 2000 BC), according to archaeologists. 
                Stonehenge is located on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, two miles west of Amesbury. 
                The structure is consisting of an outer of vertical sarsen standing stones, standing around thirteen feet high, seven feet wide each. 
                Each stone weighs around twenty-five tons, with a horizontal lintel stone on top of them. 
                The ruined monument is aligned toward the sunrise on the summer solstice and is one of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom. 
                Stonehenge has been regarded as a British cultural icon and has been a legally protected scheduled monument since 1882. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Discovery of deposits that contains human bones that date from as early as 3000 BC could indicate that Stonehenge could have been constructed as a burial ground. 
                Stonehenge and its surrounding were added to the UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986 and owned by the Crown. 
                The site is managed by English Heritage and the surrounding land is owned by National Trust.

        <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
        <p>A wrought-iron lattice tower constructed on the Champ de Mars in Paris from 1887 to 1889. 
            It was named after the engineer named Gustave Eiffel, the man whose company designed and built the tower. 
            Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier are the two senior engineers, working for the “Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel”, who attributed to the design of the Eiffel Tower.  
            Eiffel tower is locally nicknamed “la dame de fer”, which is French for “Iron Lady”. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Eiffel Tower was constructed as the centrepiece of the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticised by some France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design. 
            However, it later became a global cultural icon of France and is one of the most recognisable structures in the world. 
            The tower is 330 metres tall, around the same height as an 81-storey building and is labelled as the tallest structure in Paris.

            <h3>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest pyramids in Egypt, which is the tomb of the fourth dynasty pharaoh Khufu. 
                It was built in the early 26th century BC, which took 27 years to complete. 
                The pyramid is the oldest structure of the Seven Wonders and is part of the Giza pyramid complex. 
                The pyramid borders present-day Giza in Greater Cairo. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Great Pyramid stands at 481 feet high and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. 
                A couple of the smooth white limestone have been removed over time, which has lowered the pyramid's height to 454.4 feet high.
                2.3 million large blocks, weighting six million tonnes, were used to build the Great Pyramid. 
                The local limestone that was used to construct the Great Pyramid primarily came from the Giza Plateau, while other blocks are imported down the Nile by boats.
